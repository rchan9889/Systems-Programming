test plan:
1. Test for coalescing free blocks
2. Test cases for individual errors
    Malloc:
    a. size <= 0
    b. size > MEMLENGTH
    c. size > remaining heap size
        fill the heap with other malloc()
        call malloc() in which the collective malloc() size is greater thahn 4096
    Free:
    d. heap not initialized
        call free() without calling malloc() first
    e. freeing an address not obtained from malloc()
        call malloc()
        call free() on another random variable
    f. freeing address not at start of chunk
        call malloc() i.e. x
        call free(x + 1)
    g. double freeing
        call malloc()
        call free() on the same address twice
