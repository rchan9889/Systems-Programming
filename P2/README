test plan:
1. testa - example test prompt
2. testb, testc, & junk - traverse through one directory, read text file inside said directory, ignore non .txt file
3. testd, teste - traverse through subdirectory in directory testb and read text file
4. testf - test for very long text file (Bee Move script should be long enough)
5. testg, testh - ignore subdirectory testg as begins with .
6. testi - test for weird cases involving apostrophes and hyphens
7. testk - random assortment of numbers, cannot figure out why the output appears to be 0-3 random characters, when numbers    are changed, there is no output (as should be according to instructions)
